# LSHVec pre-trained models and its Python bindings 

This project is still in progress. Check it later.

## Summary

This repository presents a few of pre-tained models for [LSHVec](https://github.com/Lizhen0909/LSHVec). 

Python codes and examples to uses these models are also provided. 

## Requirements

1. Python 3.6
2. Jnius >=1.1.0


## Pre-trained model

### refdb virus classfication model

## Sample data

* ActinoMock Nanopore Sample [file size: 500M].

  The data is used in example notebook [example_use_vectors_in_bacteria_classfication_model.ipynb](notebook/example_use_vectors_in_bacteria_classfication_model.ipynb).
